# NVGT Player
A simple example sound player for [NVGT](https://nvgt.gg).

## Why?
I wanted a simple sound player that would allow me to listen to a web stream and adjust the volume. More can be added later, but I thought this example might be useful to somebody wishing to load web URLs etc.


## Todo
If I get time, here are some of the things I want to add:
* If the stream fails, retry. Not sure how easy this is.
* There is much more...
